Hello World
First of all, i should learn how to use Hugo, roots or even get on the Jekyll hype. (roots seems pretty..pretty) 

Stuff which I should be putting on this darn page but properly will forget about:

	CTF stuff (vulnhub,exploit-exercises etc)
	Notes on Pentesting
	Notes on defending the infrastructure and all that jazz
	Notes about fixes for various projects and so on 
	Thoughts about the security industry in general
	Pictures from my baby(Fuji X100T)
	Links to projects which i am crapcoding
		note to self: Remember to setup github to exclude config files with api keys and other wonderfully sensitive stuff.

	Links to various resources which i use on a daily basis (sharing is caring, right?)

	Explain to people why the gotta get their act together and implement X (possibly help with resources to make it easier to get going)
		2 factor authentication	-  for your pet, door, wife, daughter,son, parants and bladder.
		ssh keys		-  link to some easy how to tutorials / more in-depth 
		Implement whitelists 	-  and not blacklists...(its okay to hate me, but you should know by now its the only way)
		AD/GPO tips n tricks 	-  ( macros, monitoring admin account creation and so on)
		Setting up a NIDS	-  security onion and why it will give you more then just a oh no, trojans every, insight.
		Your ip range + shodan	-  what are you exposing? and how to utilize simple techniques to figure out what you forgot to block in your firewall
		



**Write a nonsens disclaimer about not caring about grammar and excempt yourself from all responsibility (possibly blame someone else?..socioty,government,chemtrails!)
